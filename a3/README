Gerogia Tech cs7641 Assignment 3
Spring 2019

Author: Edward Scott Daniels  

Requirements and running the code for this assignment:

The code requires:
	python3
	sklearn
	numpy
	scipy
	bash


Assuming the code has been downloaded as a .tgz file from the source,
and unpacked into the current directory where such that bin and data
subdirectories exist, then the following commands should be used to 
run the code:

# run for adult data
./bin/run k adult		# k-means clustering
./bin/run e adult		# Em clustering
./bin/run d adult		# dimsion reduction 
./bin/run a adult		# ann on dimensionally reduced data
./bin/run c adult		# ann on data with cluster (combined data )

# run for crowd data
./bin/run k crowd		# k-means clustering
./bin/run e crowd		# Em clustering
./bin/run d crowd		# dimsion reduction 
./bin/run a crowd		# ann on dimensionally reduced data
./bin/run c crowd		# ann on data with cluster (combined data )

Stats are written to standard error. If the code generates plot 
output (.eps) files they are written to /tmp.

Add -d directory-name to any command (before the first parameter)
to write plot output to a different directory. Not all commands
generate plot output.


For more details, the bin/run script can be consulted, but you really
should not need to.  Example output:

%% [/data]bin/run e adult
#em.py    -k 2 -i 3 /data/data/adult/adult_train.csv /data/data/adult/adult_test.csv
data: 48844 instances  10 parameters
